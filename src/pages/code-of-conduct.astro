          We deeply regret the screening of "Jawn and Jaundice" at JawnCon 2023. Although we believe the filmmaker's 
          intent was to hold space for historically marginalized groups, we see now that the impact it's had runs counter
          to the inclusive principles of JawnCon. We apologize deeply for the irreparable damage, pain, and aggravated
          generational truama inflicted by this film.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          In particular, we extend our deepest apologies to the estate of Jane Austin, the city of Vancouver, and Colin Firth.

          Our Jawn Ambassadors are highly trained professionals in the art of jawn presentation and cable untangling. They deserve your utmost respect and professional courtesy. Remember:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>Booth Babes are experts, not decorations</li>
          <li>Inappropriate advances will result in immediate ejection and forfeiture of all jawns</li>
          <li>Yes, they've heard your dice joke before</li>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">Core Principles of Jawn Trading</h2>
        
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-lg space-y-4 ml-4">
          <li>
            <strong>All jawn trades must be consensual.</strong> Both parties must explicitly agree to the exchange. Coercion, deception, or "jawn-shaming" will not be tolerated.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>No wet jawns near the Cable Swap Pit.</strong> THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR WHICH YOU WILL BE SOLELY LIABLE IF YOU VIOLATE THIS RULE, OR ARE IN THE PIT WHEN THIS RULE IS BEING VIOLATED.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Dice rolls to settle disputes are binding and final.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>No counterfeit jawns.</strong> That includes "replica" rusty nails, 3D-printed dice, or any paperclip not bent by human hands. Labor rights are human rights.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>Maintain proper hygiene.</strong> Make sure your pants fit appropriately and do not expose your person.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>Photography requires consent.</strong>
