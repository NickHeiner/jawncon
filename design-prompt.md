# JawnCon Visual Design Brief

## Overview

Redesign JawnCon to appear as a legitimate, high-end professional conference website with subtle visual elements that create an uncanny, slightly "off" feeling. The derangement should be discovered, not announced.

## Visual Direction

### Overall Aesthetic

- **Style:** Premium conference design language (think TED, Web Summit, or SXSW)
- **Approach:** 95% legitimate, 5% unsettling
- **Goal:** Professional facade with creeping realization that something is amiss

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**

- Deep Conference Blue: #1a3a52
- Professional Teal: #007C89
- Clean White: #ffffff
- Subtle Gray: #f8f9fa

**Accent Colors:**

- Muted Gold: #d4a574 (for premium/VIP sections)
- Dusty Rose: #c97d7d (inexplicably appears in random places)
- Industrial Yellow: #fade00 (safety/warning elements)

### Typography

**Fonts:**

- Headlines: Inter or Helvetica Neue (clean, professional)
- Body: Open Sans or Source Sans Pro
- Occasional accent text in Playfair Display (overly elegant for the content)
- One random section inexplicably uses Courier New

### Layout Principles

1. **Grid System:** Professional 12-column grid that occasionally breaks into 11 columns
2. **Spacing:** Generous whitespace with mysteriously tight margins in random sections
3. **Hierarchy:** Clear visual hierarchy that subtly degrades as you scroll down

### Key Visual Elements

**Hero Section:**

- Full-width gradient background (professional blue to teal)
- High-quality photo of convention center exterior
- Overlaid with semi-transparent geometric shapes
- Date displayed in unnecessarily specific format ("February 14.000 - 24.999, 2023")

**Photography Style:**

- Professional conference photography aesthetic
- Slightly too much depth of field blur
- People in photos never quite looking at the camera
- Subtle DALL-E artifacts in background elements
- Mix of stock photos and AI-generated images that almost pass as real

**Section Styling:**

- Clean card-based layouts with subtle drop shadows
- Border radius: 8px everywhere except one section with 7px
- Professional icons that occasionally don't match their labels
- Background patterns that are almost imperceptible geometric jawns

**Content Blocks:**

- Statistics presented in professional infographic style
- Numbers that are oddly specific (32,608 jawns, not 32,000)
- Testimonial sections with professional headshots where everyone looks vaguely similar
- Speaker cards where titles get progressively longer

### Visual Quirks (Subtle)

- Logo appears professional but contains a tiny dice dot pattern
- Section dividers use a wave pattern that resembles scattered paperclips
- Footer links organized by length rather than importance
- Copyright year listed as "2023-2024ish"
- Venue maps with unnecessary detail about nearby Papa John's locations
- Sponsor logos at slightly different sizes despite grid system
- One testimonial photo is clearly someone's LinkedIn screenshot

### Image Treatment

- All images have consistent 8px border radius except hero images (9px)
- Subtle vignetting on all photos
- Color grading that makes everything slightly more beige
- Conference crowd photos where everyone appears to be holding small objects

### Visual Consistency Rules

- Maintain professional appearance at first glance
- Inconsistencies should require attention to notice
- Each section should have one small "wrong" detail
- Premium design quality throughout, even for absurd content

### Background Elements

- Subtle dot pattern that upon inspection is tiny jawns
- Gradient overlays that shift slightly too much
- Geometric shapes that don't quite align with the grid
- Watermarks that say "CONFIDENTIAL" on public pages

### Badge/Credential Design

- Professional conference badge aesthetic
- QR codes that are slightly too complex
- Lanyards shown in lifestyle photos are unreasonably long
- Badge holder names get progressively more generic ("Attendee," "Person," "Entity")

## Design Principles

1. **First Impression:** Completely legitimate tech/business conference
2. **Second Look:** Wait, what are they trading?
3. **Deep Inspection:** Subtle visual inconsistencies throughout
4. **Overall Feel:** Uncanny valley of conference websites

The key is restraint. This should look like a real conference website designed by professionals who were given slightly wrong instructions. The derangement comes from the content and subtle visual choices, not obvious chaos.
